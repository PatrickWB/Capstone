The bean files go under your unite.beans folder. So do Group.java and User.java. 
This is the version where things are hardcoded to work. Once we get the session stuff figured out, that will change.

Edit profile is not finished. It needs to actually edit the profile and be hidden until the user clicks the button to edit, I imagine.


Also, when I worked on this there was not an attribute for User city. There is now, so that will need to be updated within the User class and also the ProfileBean.java and also need to be displayed using dashboard.xhtml under the profile tab.
